.. code-block:: bash

    # The following commands require pipenv as a dependency

    # To lint the project
    _CI/scripts/lint.py

    # To execute the testing
    _CI/scripts/test.py

    # To create a graph of the package and dependency tree

To use towerlib in a project:

.. code-block:: python

    from towerlib import Tower

    # using http (pick one)
    tower = Tower('ansible.domain.com', 'username', 'password')

    # using https with a valid cert (pick one)
    tower = Tower('ansible.domain.com', 'username', 'password', secure=True)

    # using https with an invalid cert (pick one)
    tower = Tower('ansible.domain.com', 'username', 'password', secure=True, ssl_verify=False)

    # using https with a custom certificate authority (pick one)
    tower = Tower('ansible.domain.com', 'username', 'password', secure=True, ssl_verify='/etc/ssl/certs/example.com.ca.crt')

    # using https with an OAUTH2 token (pick one)
    tower = Tower('ansible.domain.com', None, None, secure=True, token="token-data-here")

    # access hosts
    for host in tower.hosts:
        print(host.name)

    # access groups
    for group in tower.groups:
        print(group.name)

    # access inventories
    for inventory in tower.inventories:
        print(inventory.name)

    # access organizations
    for organization in tower.organizations:
        print(organization.name)

    # access users
    for user in tower.users:
        print(user.username)

    # access projects
    for project in tower.projects:
        print(project.name)

    # access teams
    for team in tower.teams:
        print(team.name)
        
    # access jobs
    for job in tower.jobs:
        print(job.name)
        
    # all of the above entities also support a dictionary of filters which are provided
    # to the api, reducing query time. For filterable terms, see
    # https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/towerapi/filtering.html
    
    # failed jobs
    for job in tower.jobs.filter({"status":"failed"}):
        print(job.name)
    # successful jobs
    for job in tower.jobs.filter({"status": "successful"}):
        print(job.name)       
        

    # all the above entities support creation and deletion either from the core tower object
    # or from their respective parent object.
    # eg: create a host
    tower.create_host_in_inventory('inventory_name','host_name', 'host description', 'variable_json')

    # or
    inventory = tower.get_inventory_by_name('inventory_name')
    inventory.create_host('host_name', 'host description', 'variable_json')
